## About

`git-dive` is for better understanding why a change was made.  Frequently, we
work on code bases we didn't start which have too little documentation.  Even
worse if the original authors are not around.  `git-blame` is an invaluable
tool for this but it requires a lot of ceremony to get the information you
need.

Features
- Git-native experience
- Syntax highlighting
- Focuses on relative references (e.g. `HEAD~10`)
  - More room for code by merging the SHA and Time columns into a rev column
  - Easier to compare timestamps via the rev column (e.g. `HEAD~10`)
  - Easier to remember, avoiding the need for copy/pasting SHAs
- Focuses on "blaming" merge-commits (PRs) to more quickly see the whole context for a change
- Easy to find relevant config with `git dive --dump-config -`

Planned Features
- [Interactive pager that let's you browse through time](https://github.com/gitext-rs/git-dive/milestone/2)
- [Reverse blame](https://github.com/gitext-rs/git-dive/issues/21)

`git-dive` was inspired by [perforce time lapse
view](https://www.perforce.com/video-tutorials/vcs/using-time-lapse-view).
